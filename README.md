# haskell-progression

WIP: Learn Haskell from scratch by progressing toward building stuff.

See https://github.com/srid/haskell-template for dev instructions. Then start from [src/Progression/P01.hs](src/Progression/P01.hs).

## Presenting your solutions

Open a PR on GitHub so your instructor can review the diff and give feedback. The PRs will not be merged, of course.

## Tasks

- [ ] Don't hard `P0?` in src/Main.hs. Use `.ghcid` maybe.
